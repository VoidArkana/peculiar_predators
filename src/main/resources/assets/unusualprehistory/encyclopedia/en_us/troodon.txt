These small dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous are known to be mighty hunters! Troodons like to travel in large packs in the dead of night searching for prey, but during the day they tend to be rather passive. They drop Troodon drumsticks when slain, which happen to be the favorite food of the Yutyrannus!
